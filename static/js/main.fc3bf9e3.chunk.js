Pair programming happens almost everyday after each lecture. All our activities were version controlled in git and managed in github. Every friday there is a group project which lasts for one day. In this bootcamp I developed my communication skills, leadership skills, understanding of team dynamics, self awareness, technical skills, and other soft skills. During the lockdown, we continued to work remotely, building projects with up to teams of 20 people collaborating online.
