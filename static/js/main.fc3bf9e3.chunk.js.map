During my time at Jasper,\n                I was exposed to a variety of sub-professional work in the field\n                of software development. I learned about how to build the\n                front-end of web applications with high attention to detail,\n                performance and accessibility. I also learned various social\n                aspects when working in a team environment to ensure good\n                productivity as this is my first time working at a company. The\n                main conclusions drawn were that working at Jasper was an\n                overall positive experience where I learned about how to\n                professionally create web applications. The overall workflow at\n                Jasper allowed for efficient shipping of work and made keeping\n                track of tasks simple but effective.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Starting from day one, I went straight into sub professional\n                work on Jasper’s website. But first, I had to go through an\n                onboarding process on the first day. This onboarding involved\n                setting up my working environment and getting used to Mac as\n                this was my first time using it for development. My sub\n                professional work included implementing UX and UI in React\n                applications, writing integration and unit tests, communicating\n                with graphql APIs and schema changes, implementing polished user\n                interfaces, sharing sub-professional knowledge amongst team\n                members, writing documentation on Github and Linear, performing\n                maintenance on existing code base, regular standups and\n                retrospectives as part of an agile workplace, and reviewing pull\n                requests.\n              </p>\n            </Col>\n          </Row>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"work-experience-item\">\n          <Row>\n            <Col md={4}></Col>\n            <Col md={8}>\n              <h2>FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPER AT ENSPIRAL DEV ACADEMY</h2>\n            </Col>\n          </Row>\n          <Row>\n            <Col md={4} className=\"work-experience-img-container\">\n              <img className=\"work-experience-img\" src=\"./eda.png\" alt=\"\" />\n            </Col>\n            <Col md={8}>\n              <p>\n                EDA’s curriculum is designed and taught by currently employed\n                software developers and was designed to turn someone from no\n                experience in software to a full stack web developer in 15\n                weeks. A normal day in this bootcamp was usually around 10-12\n                hours of work a day. I was exposed to agile software practices\n                when taking part in group projects. Pair programming happens\n                almost everyday after each lecture. All our activities were\n                version controlled in git and managed in github. Every friday\n                there is a group project which lasts for one day. In this\n                bootcamp I developed my communication skills, leadership skills,\n                understanding of team dynamics, self awareness, technical\n                skills, and other soft skills. During the lockdown, we continued\n                to work remotely, building projects with up to teams of 20\n                people collaborating online. We would give and receive feedback\n                to each other on a regular basis to allow ourselves to grow at a\n                faster rate. In summary, it was a tough but enjoyable experience\n                that gave me good insight into what software development is like\n                in a professional environment.\n              </p>\n            </Col>\n          </Row>\n        </div>\n      </Container>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default WorkExperience;\n","import Homepage from './Homepage';\r\n\r\nexport default Homepage;\r\n","import React, { Fragment } from \"react\";\r\nimport About from \"./About\";\r\nimport Engineering from \"./Engineering\";\r\nimport Landing from \"./Landing\";\r\nimport WebDeveloper from \"./WebDeveloper\";\r\nimport WorkExperience from \"./WorkExperience\";\r\n\r\nconst Homepage = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <Fragment>\r\n      <Landing />\r\n      <About />\r\n      <WebDeveloper />\r\n      <Engineering />\r\n      <WorkExperience />\r\n    </Fragment>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Homepage;\r\n","import Portfolio from './Portfolio';\r\n\r\nexport default Portfolio;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst Portfolio = () => {\r\n  return <div>Welcome to Portfolio</div>;\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Portfolio;\r\n","import Navbar from \"./Navbar\"\r\n\r\nexport default Navbar","import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\r\nimport Navbar from 'react-bootstrap/Navbar';\r\nimport Nav from 'react-bootstrap/Nav';\r\nimport Container from 'react-bootstrap/Container';\r\nimport './navbar.css';\r\n\r\nconst NavbarMain = (props) => {\r\n  const [location, setLocation] = useState(props.pathName);\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    setLocation(props.pathName);\r\n  }, [props.pathName]);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <Navbar className=\"navbar-main\" bg=\"dark\" expand=\"lg\" variant=\"dark\">\r\n      <Container>\r\n        <Navbar.Brand href=\"#/\">Christopher Sy Alba</Navbar.Brand>\r\n        <Navbar.Toggle aria-controls=\"basic-navbar-nav\" />\r\n        <Navbar.Collapse id=\"basic-navbar-nav\">\r\n          <Nav className=\"ml-auto\">\r\n            <Nav.Link className={`${location === '/' ?
